            I really love the Museum of Jurrassic technology, and what makes the typography of their website one of my favorites is brand cohesion and coding minimalism. The museum itself feels like a strange anomily pulled from the 19th century, so the website reflects that, maintaining the aesthetic&mdash;simple, times font, tiled background image, div bars, and centered layout&mdash;of the early 2000s internet. In fact, I know that they haven't graphically updated their website in at least 10 years or so. Additionally, the site has a clean, formal color palate perfect for the museum.

            I really hate the typography from the website of my online music theory workbook. Judging on the mixed fonts (mixed serif and sans serif), all of which are standards, and the unfitting logo in the upper left corner, which is faded and posesses a rop shadow unlike any other elements, it feels like no one put any thought into the brand identity of 'Techniques, Materials, and Music', how that would inform the typography of this about page, or even the graphical cohesion of this page iteself. Also, the link bar at the bottom seems horribly underthought as well.
