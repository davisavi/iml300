    <h2>behind my signature color, <span class="blue">bob rosss blue</span>, and the coding of the nav bar</h2>
    <p>I chose my signature color from memory. It's the blue of smooth, black hair in the sunlight. This blue is a blue so purely, intensely pigmented so as to be hyperreal&mdash;only visible online. It's named after my new music project, a variation on the name of my favorite television star.</p>
    <p>For the nav bar, I edited the W3 Tutorial styling code provided on the wiki on the index page first (along with the title) in a new css document, then made changes to the html of the navigation and title on the index page. After I fiddled around with more styling, such as text decoratios, boarders, and fixed positioning in the css document, I copy and pasted the new html of the nav bar and title from the index onto every main page on my website. The goal of my graphic editing for the nav bar as well as the site is to make it easy, clean, and intuitive. Titles are larger, and the nav bar is fixed, unifying and defining a consitent digital space throughout all pages.</p>
